WHAT IS IT?

This is a plugin for the Roundcube Webmail web application for VERY
special (read: seldom/strange) setups only. It implements a simple is it
mounted or not" monitoring for a mail server's mail storage. This means
1. the IMAP server must run on the same host as the Web server
2. the mail storage must be a seperately mountable volume.

If the storage is not mounted, an error message is permanently shown in
the lower right corner and most controls of the Roundcube UI get disabled
including the ability to login.


INSTALLATION

1. If you're not using "composer" to install the plugin: create a directory
   "plugins/mail_storage_monitoring" in your Roundcube installation and copy
   all files there.
2. Inside that directory, copy "config.inc.php.dist" to "config.inc.php"
   and edit it. Change the config variable inside appropriately.
3. Add "mail_storage_monitoring" to the $config['plugins'] array in
   Roundcube's own config/config.inc.php.
